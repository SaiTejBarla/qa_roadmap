# 🚀 QA Automation Roadmap (Python Only)

This repository tracks my journey to becoming a **QA Automation Engineer** with a focus on **Python**.  
Goal: Land a **Product-Based Internship (6–12 months)** and a **Full-Time QA/SDET role (12–18 months)**.

## 📌 Final Goal (End of Year)
- **Best Case:** Internship at a product-based company → converted to full-time.  
- **Safe Case:** Internship → then use it + portfolio for full-time role.  
- **Fallback Case:** No internship, but strong projects + GitHub portfolio → land product QA/SDET job directly.
