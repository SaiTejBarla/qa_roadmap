Excellent\! Integrating these elements will make your roadmap even more robust and help you stand out. Here is the updated and expanded version of your QA Automation Roadmap.

# 🚀 QA Automation Roadmap (Python Only) - Updated

This repository tracks my journey to becoming a **QA Automation Engineer** with a focus on **Python**.

Goal: Land a **Product-Based Internship (6–12 months)** and a **Full-Time QA/SDET role (12–18 months)**.

-----

## 📌 Roadmap Overview

  - ✅ **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Python + QA Fundamentals**
  - ✅ **Phase 2 (Weeks 3–5): Automation Frameworks (Selenium + PyTest)**
  - ✅ **Phase 3 (Weeks 6–7): API Testing + CI/CD Basics**
  - ✅ **Phase 4 (Weeks 8–10): Advanced Automation Projects + Portfolio**
  - ✅ **Phase 5 (Weeks 11–12): Job Prep + Internship Conversion**

### **Week 1 – Python Basics**

  - [x] Variables & Input/Output
  - [x] Operators & Simple Calculator
  - [x] Loops (for, while)
  - [x] Functions
  - [x] Lists (append, insert, loop through)
  - [x] Tuples (immutability, count, index)
  - [x] Sets (unique values, union, intersection, difference)

👉 Folder: [`week1/`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./week1)

-----

### **Week 2 – Python Intermediate**

  - [x] Exception Handling (try/except/finally, custom errors)
  - [x] Practice small projects (word counter, file reader)

👉 Folder: `week2/`

-----

### **Week 3 – Python OOP**

  - [ ] Classes & Objects
  - [ ] Inheritance
  - [ ] Encapsulation & Polymorphism
  - [ ] Real-world QA examples (TestCase class, Report generator)
  - [ ] **Mini-Project:** Build a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure for a simple website (e.g., login, dashboard page).

👉 Folder: `week3/`

-----

### **Week 4–5 – Selenium + PyTest Framework**

  - [ ] Selenium basics (locators, waits, actions)
  - [ ] PyTest basics (assertions, fixtures, markers)
  - [ ] Page Object Model (POM)
  - [ ] Logging & Reporting (Allure, HTML reports)
  - [ ] **Mini-Project:** Create a mini automation framework from scratch, applying POM, fixtures, and logging.

👉 Folder: `week4-5/`

-----

### **Week 6–7 – API + CI/CD**

  - [ ] API Testing with Postman (manual exploration)
  - [ ] Python `requests` + PyTest for API automation
  - [ ] GitHub Actions (CI/CD basics: build, test workflow)
  - [ ] Docker basics (running tests in containers)
  - [ ] **Project:** Automate a public API (e.g., a weather API or dummy JSON API) with PyTest and integrate it with a CI/CD pipeline.

👉 Folder: `week6-7/`

-----

### **Week 8–10 – Advanced Automation Projects + Portfolio**

  - [ ] Advanced Selenium (parallel execution, cross-browser)
  - [ ] BrowserStack / Sauce Labs cloud execution
  - [ ] **Portfolio Project:** Automate an e-commerce site (UI + API + CI/CD + reports). This will be the centerpiece of your portfolio.
  - [ ] **Portfolio Curation:** Organize the e-commerce project on GitHub with a detailed `README.md` explaining the framework architecture, technologies used, and how to run the tests.
  - [ ] **Add test artifacts:** Include examples of well-written test cases and bug reports (as screenshots or markdown files).

👉 Folder: `week8-10/`

-----

### **Week 11–12 – Job Prep**

  - [ ] **Coding Practice:** Master fundamental Python concepts through LeetCode (Easy/Medium) or HackerRank. Focus on strings, arrays, dictionaries, and sets.
  - [ ] **QA Interview Prep:**
      - [ ] **Manual & Automation Concepts:** Review core QA principles, SDLC, STLC, test methodologies, types of testing (smoke, sanity, regression).
      - [ ] **SDET-specific questions:** Be ready to discuss the difference between an SDET and a QA Engineer, testing pyramid, and how to handle flaky tests.
      - [ ] **System Design:** Prepare for questions like, "How would you design an automation framework from scratch?" and "How would you test a new feature like a login page?"
      - [ ] **Behavioral questions:** Practice answering with the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for questions about teamwork, challenges, and conflict resolution.
  - [ ] **Open-source QA contribution**
  - [ ] **Internship conversion** → full-time

👉 Folder: `week11-12/`

-----

## 📌 Final Goal (End of Year)

  - **Best Case:** Internship at a product-based company → converted to full-time.
  - **Safe Case:** Internship → then use it + strong portfolio for a full-time role.
  - **Fallback Case:** No internship, but strong projects + GitHub portfolio → land a product QA/SDET job directly.
